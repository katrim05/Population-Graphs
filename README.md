# Population-Graphs
This project creates a website that allows you to create population graphs using World Bank data. 

It's based on an online workshop by Sympa, in the form of a MOOC that I completed in April 2020. The course can be accessed here: <a href="https://sympaoy.github.io/webcodingforbeginners/" target="blank">Web Coding for Beginners: Population Graphs</a>

I have done some alterations to the basic code we were required to create, mainly styling the webpage/app with CSS, and adding a footer with HTML. I intend to do more improvements in the near future, including error-catching and additional functionality with JavaScript. 

This app isn't currently hosted anywhere, and I've only been accessing it locally, but I might put it online later when I'm happy with how it works.
